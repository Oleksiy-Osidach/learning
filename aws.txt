IAM  Identity and Access Management
____________________
AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) provides fine-grained access control across all of AWS. 
With IAM, you can specify who can access which services and resources, and under which conditions.
With IAM policies, you manage permissions to your workforce and systems to ensure least-privilege permissions.

Best practices
1. Delete your root access keys
2. Activate MFA
3. Create individual IAM users
4. User groups to assign permissions
5. Apply an IAM password policy

IAM -  управління користувачами, групами та ролями.

IAM make three sections

1. Users and Policies - create, change, delete users and assign permissions this users
2. Groups and Policies -  create, change, delete group assign permissions this group. Is needed not to notify each user separately if there are similar.
3. Roles - This section provides permissions to access AWS services to other AWS services. For example, the program access to the Data Base, or to the storage basket



VPC  Virtual Private Cloud
____________________________
 (Amazon VPC) enables you to launch AWS resources into a virtual network
 
 AWS internet gateway  communication between your VPC and the internet

 AWS route table - are used to determine where network traffic from your subnet or gateway is directed

 AWS NACL - Network Access Control List, helps provide a layer of security to the AWS.

 AWS subnet - helps create subnet in your VPS.

AWS availability zones - one or more data centers whit redundant power and internet, conect in one AWS Region

AWS region - this physical location i world data centers, where each A-Z.



Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)
____________________________________________

Save any data at any time, from anywhere
When create a bucket - select region. 
Best practics - select region closest to you or if you need your clients

Bucket - root level "Folders", any "subfolders" - folder.
File in folder - object

Free Tier - 5Gb and 20k GET requests, 2k put rec.

RULES Bucket names:
 - must unique in ALL AWS
 - 3-63 length
 - only small letters, numbers and hyphens
 - not be an IP address

S3 storage Classes
 - standart
   - default class
   - 99.99999999999 durability
   - 99.99 availabity
   - hight cost

 - RRS reduced redundancy storage
   - non-critical object
   - 99.99 durability
   - 99.99 availabity
   - smalest cost than in the standard

 - S3-IA infrequent access 
   - not frequency but must availabity
   - 99.99999999999 durability
   - 99.90 availabity
   - smalest cost than in the standard or RRS
 
 - Glacier
   - long-term archival storage
   - 99.99999999999 durability
   - may take several hours to be retrived
   - very low cost
 

Select storage class that dictate 
 - storage cost
 - avalibility
 - durability
    
Lifecycle S3 Object
This set of rules that automate the migration 
object befor storage classes (or delete).

S3 Versioning 
that keeps trak of and stores all old/new versions of an object



Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)
____________________________________________

EC2 components:
 - AMIs (Win or Linux)
 - Instance Type (CPU)
 - EBS (Hdd)
 - Ip Addressing (Network Card)
 - Secutity Groups (Firewall)
 - RAM

EC2 purchasing options
 - On-Demand - any time
 - Reserved - set time period (1-3 years)
 - Spot - use if you bid = <

AMI Amazon Machine Image
(preconfigured package required to launch an EC2 instance)
 - Community AMIs (Free)
 - AWS marketplace AMIs (pay)
 - My AMIs (create)

Instance Types
 - is the computer power og your instance

 - Components
   - Famile - memory, GPU, Computer, General, storage
   - Type - subcategory fot family type-
   - VCPUs - the number of virtual CPUs
   - Memory - RAM
   - Instance storage - hard drive
   - EBS-Optomized Available - Amazon Elastic Block Store
   - Network performance - speed 

???? EBS Elastic Block Store
 - is like a hard drive in the cloud that provides persistent block storage volumes for use with Amazon EC2 instances. EBS volumes are placed in an availability zone, where they are automatically replicated to protect data loss from the failure of a single component.

 Security Groups
  -SG - a virtual firewall that controls the traffic for one or more istance

 
 Ip addressing
    -2 ip, in (vpc) and out (internet)
    
    -EC2- Public IP - SG - NACL - Route Table - Internet Getway - internet

  RDS - Relational Database Service
  is a SQL db service that provides a wide range of SQL db options to select from
    Amazone Aurora, MySQL, Postgre SQL
