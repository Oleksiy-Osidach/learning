IAM  Identity and Access Management
____________________
AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) provides fine-grained access control across all of AWS. 
With IAM, you can specify who can access which services and resources, and under which conditions.
With IAM policies, you manage permissions to your workforce and systems to ensure least-privilege permissions.

Best practices
1. Delete your root access keys
2. Activate MFA
3. Create individual IAM users
4. User groups to assign permissions
5. Apply an IAM password policy

IAM -  управління користувачами, групами та ролями.

IAM make three sections

1. Users and Policies - create, change, delete users and assign permissions this users
2. Groups and Policies -  create, change, delete group assign permissions this group. Is needed not to notify each user separately if there are similar.
3. Roles - This section provides permissions to access AWS services to other AWS services. For example, the program access to the Data Base, or to the storage basket
